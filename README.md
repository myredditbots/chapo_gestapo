Maintained by main account /u/GimmeFuel_GimmeGuy

This is a automated bot that digs into a user's comment history and determines if they're a Chapo poster. 
The bot is called by pinging /u/chapo_gestapo in a reply comment to the user. At the moment, it responds to requests in any subreddit.
If the user is a Chapo poster, it prints out detailed stuff
about the user like:

* Number of Chapo Comments
* Average score of comments
* Best comment
* Worst comment

The bot works on user pings right now, because the previous ones didn't and they all got banned. I'm not sure if that's the reason why they
did, but I'm just playing it safe. At some point I might make it automatic. Fuck it, if you want an automatic one, just change the 
shit in main() really quick. It's not a hard fix.

Honestly, I dont really give a fuck if anyone copies this shit and steals it for their own bot. I fucking suck at Guython, and most of this shit can
be written better, so take it and do whatever you want with it. I'm throwing this up as open source, so if the original /u/chapo_gestapo bot gets shut down
someone can literally just download this .py, change some of the Oauth information, and have it running again.
